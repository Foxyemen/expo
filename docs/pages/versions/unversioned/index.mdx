The Expo SDK provides access to device and system functionality such as contacts, camera, gyroscope, GPS location, and more through specialized packages. You can install any Expo SDK package using the `npx expo install` command. For example:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-camera expo-contacts expo-sensors']} />

After installation, import the packages into your JavaScript code:

```js
import { CameraView } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Contacts from 'expo-contacts';
import { Gyroscope } from 'expo-sensors';
```

This enables functionality like [`Contacts.getContactsAsync()`](./sdk/contacts#contactsgetcontactsasynccontactquery) for accessing device contacts, reading gyroscope sensor data to detect device movement, or using the phone's camera to take photos.

## Expo SDK packages work in any React Native app

Since Expo apps are React Native apps, all Expo SDK packages are compatible with any React Native app that has the `expo` package properly installed and configured. The simplest way to create a React Native app with Expo SDK support is using `create-expo-app`. Alternatively, you can add Expo SDK support to an existing React Native app by running `npx install-expo-modules`.

<Terminal
  cmd={['# Create a project named my-app', '$ npx create-expo-app my-app --template bare-minimum']}
  cmdCopy="npx create-expo-app my-app --template bare-minimum"
/>

## Using pre-release versions

Expo releases three SDK versions annually. Between these releases, we publish pre-release versions of the `expo` package and all Expo SDK packages. Note that pre-releases aren't considered stable and should only be used if you're comfortable with potential bugs or issues.

### Canary releases

Canary releases represent snapshots of the `main` branch at publication time. These versions include `-canary` in their name along with the date and commit hash (e.g., `51.0.0-canary-20240418-8d74597`). To install the latest canary release:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Install the alpha version of expo and its related packages',
    '$ npm install expo@canary && npx expo install --fix',
  ]}
  cmdCopy="npm install expo@canary && npx expo install --fix"
/>

Pre-release versions of individual packages often work with stable Expo SDK releases, though occasional incompatibilities may occur. You might want to [silence dependency validation warnings](/more/expo-cli/#configuring-dependency-validation) after verifying the canary package works for your use case.

### Beta releases

Before each Expo SDK release, we publish beta versions of all packages. These are more stable than canary releases, and we encourage developers to test them and provide feedback. Beta releases use the `beta` npm tag - follow the instructions in the related [changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog) post.

## Each Expo SDK version supports a specific React Native version

### Additional information

<Collapsible summary="Expo SDK policy for tracking React Native releases">

- Expo releases three SDK versions annually, each targeting one React Native version (typically the latest stable at release time)
- While React Native's release cadence varies (currently targeting six releases in 2025), Expo SDK versions will support every second React Native release
- Our team includes a member who works on React Native releases, ensuring quick support for new versions (often same-day) in pre-release Expo SDK versions

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Why doesn't Expo release a new SDK version for every React Native release?">

Expo has found that three major annual releases provide the optimal balance of stability and innovation. We collaborate closely with Meta on releases and continually improve our processes to deliver the latest features efficiently.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="What if I need changes from a newer React Native version not yet in an Expo SDK release?">

For urgent fixes not included in the current Expo SDK, you can:
1. Use [`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to apply the fix
2. Use a [pre-release Expo SDK version](#using-pre-release-versions) ([example](https://expo.dev/changelog/react-native-78))

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use an older React Native version with the latest Expo SDK?">

Expo SDK packages are designed to support their target React Native version. While they might work with older versions, this isn't guaranteed. New React Native versions typically require weeks (or more) for full Expo SDK support, depending on the changes involved.

</Collapsible>

## Android and iOS version support

Each Expo SDK version specifies minimum OS requirements. For Android, this includes the `compileSdkVersion` which determines which Android SDK features are available. For iOS, it specifies the minimum Xcode SDK version required for compilation.

<AndroidIOSCompatibilityTable />

When upgrading your Expo SDK, consider both the SDK requirements and current app store submission guidelines. Google Play and Apple App Store periodically increase their minimum OS requirements for new submissions. For current requirements, check [Google's](https://developer.android.com/studio/build) and [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/) official documentation.
